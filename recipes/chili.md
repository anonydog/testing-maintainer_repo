# Chili

**Serves 3–4**

This is a firm favourite of mine that I’ve honed over the past couple of years.
It’s crazy hot and deep as hell with rich, smokey flavours. Best cooked for
_hours_, I typically begin cooking my chili the night before I intend to eat
it. I leave it out overnight covered but **not in the fridge** ready to begin
cooking again the next day. This gives it an amazing flavour that I’ve never had
anywhere else before. Everyone who’s tried this chili has declared it the best
they ever tasted…

The beauty of this meal is that there’s an initial bit of work in throwing
everything into a pan together, but after that you have literally hours of just
tasting and adjusting; time is the biggest ingredient here.

## Ingredients

* 400g lean beef mince
* 112g chorizo, cubed
* Large onion, diced
* 1 x habanero pepper
* 2 x chipotle pepper
* 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* 1 x 400g tin kidney beans in chili sauce
* 4tsp Cumin (powder)
* 2tsp Cinnamon (powder)
* Chunk of dark chocolate (to taste)
* Ketchup

## Method

Your chilis might need rehydrating. If so, chop the stalks off and place them
in a shallow bowl. Cover (but only just) with boiling water for 15 minutes.
Remove and finely chop once the 15 minutes is up.

1.  Sweat the onions and diced chorizo in a small amount of oil in a heavy
    bottomed pan on a low heat.
2.  Once done, add the mince and coat in cinnamon and cumin.
3.  Break the mince apart with a wooden spatula as it begins to brown.
4.  Once the meat is browned, add the tins of tomatoes and kidney beans.
5.  Stir everything together and leave to sit for a few minutes.
6.  Once the sauce and meat has combined, add chopped chilis and stir.
7.  Add a squirt of ketchup to add a sweeter flavour.
8.  Add small amounts of chocolate in chunks.
9.  Now leave everything to cook, tasting regularly and adding the ketchup,
    chocolate, cinnamon and cumin to taste.
10. If possible, cook for a number of hours. Keep tasting and adjusting as you
    go. The hard bit is done, now you sit and wait and try and resist eating
    the whole lot as it cooks!
11. I typically serve my chili quite humbly, in a bowl with a spoon, some pitta
    breads and some sour cream.
