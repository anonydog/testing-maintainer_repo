# Ragu

**Serves 3–4**

This, like my [chili](https://github.com/csswizardry/recipes/tree/master/chili),
is a really easy meal that rewards with massive flavour. It’s one you spend
time preparing and then leave to sit and simmer for hours on end. This isn’t a
recipe based on anything concrete or traditional, more trial and error and a
lot of reading anecdotal bolognese/ragu recipes.

## Ingredients

* 400g lean beef mince
* 200g cubed pancetta
* 2 x tin chopped tomatoes
* Large onion, diced
* Large carrot very finely diced
* Stick of celery finely diced
* 2 x large cloves of garlic
* Glass of red wine
* Worcestershire sauce
* Ketchup
* Fresh basil
* Parmesan cheese
* Tomato purée

## Method

1.  Sweat crushed garlic, pancetta, onion, carrot and celery in a small amount
    of oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
2.  Once softened, add mince and brown.
3.  Once mince is browned, add both tins of tomatoes.
4.  Leave to cook together on a low heat for a while.
5.  Add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and leave to simmer.
6.  Add red wine, simmer for a while.
7.  Add plenty of chopped, fresh basil.
8.  Simmer for a few hours, adjusting flavour with ketchup and Worcestershire
    sauce as you see fit.
9.  Leave covered and off the heat overnight, if you can.
10. If not, cook for as many hours as you possibly can.
11. 30 minutes before serving, stir in a tablespoon or two of parmesan cheese.
    This gives the sauce an amazing flavour!

I typically serve ragu with fresh pasta topped with plenty of parmesan and
fresh, chopped basil. And a beer.
